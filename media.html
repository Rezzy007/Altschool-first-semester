          If you enjoy a game of football like I do, you should know that in the
          history of the English Premier League (EPL), Manchester City became
          the first to win the Premier League four times consecutively. With one
          game to go, Manchester City having 88 points and Arsenal having 86
          points, the final day of the EPL 2023/24 season had fans from both
          sides constantly and nervously checking their phones for live scores
          as the outcome of the game would determine the winner.
        </p>
        <p>
          The video below highlights their performance, and how the season
          ended.
        </p>

          Interesting right? As the new EPL season begins on the 15th August
          2024,

        <form action="">
          <label for="clubs">whom do you predict would win the title?</label>

          As the season begins, I recommend checking out the latest news about
          the EPL. The

          has a section dedicated to highlights and news from the season, and if
